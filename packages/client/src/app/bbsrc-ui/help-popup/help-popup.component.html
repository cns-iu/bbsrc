<mat-dialog-content>
  <p>
    The UCSD map of science and classification system was computed using
    paper-level data from about 25,000 journals from Elsevier's Scopus and and
    Thomson Reuters' Web of Science (WoS) for the years 2001-2010. The UCSD map
    of science assigns the 25,000 journals to 554 subdisciplines that are further
    aggregated into 13 main disciplines of science. In the map, each discipline
    has a distinct color (green for 'Biology', brown for 'Earth Sciences', etc.)
    and a label. (Sub)disciplines that are similar closer to one another on the
    map. (Sub)disciplines that are especially similar are connected by grey lines.
